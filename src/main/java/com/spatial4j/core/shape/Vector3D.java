/**
 * @file: Vector3D.java
 * @brief: Generic 3 Component Vector/Point (double)
 * @author: Rebecca Alford (ralford)
 *
 * @details This class provides a generic abstraction of a 3 component vector from the origin (0, 0, 0). This
 * class is intended to be lightweight and allow easily abstraction for reuse of vector utilities. This class
 * might be used alone as a 3D vector and also as the base class for DirectionCosine Point and GeocentricPoint
 * which are both representations of a point on the spheroidal model of the earth.
