but this README has richer information)_ 

Spatial4j is a general purpose spatial / geospatial [ASL](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) licensed open-source Java library. It's core capabilities are 3-fold: to provide common shapes that can work in Euclidean and geodesic (surface of sphere) world models, to provide distance calculations and other math, and to read & write shapes from formats like [WKT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) and [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#geometry-objects).  Spatial4j is a project of the [LocationTech](http://www.locationtech.org) Industry Working Group of the Eclipse Foundation.

If you are working with spatial grid-square indexing schemes, be it [Geohash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) or something custom, then you are likely to find especially high utility from Spatial4j.

Spatial4j is well tested; it's monitored via [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/locationtech/spatial4j) continuous integration (plus another Hudson build) and we use [Codecov](https://codecov.io/github/locationtech/spatial4j/) for code coverage.

## Shapes and Other Features

The main part of Spatial4j is its collection of shapes.  Shapes in Spatial4j have these features:

* Compute its lat-lon bounding box.
* Compute an area.  For some shapes its more of an estimate.
* Compute if it contains a provided point.
* Compute the relationship to a lat-lon rectangle. Relationships are: CONTAINS, WITHIN, DISJOINT, INTERSECTS.  Note that Spatial4j doesn't have a notion of "touching".

Spatial4j has a variety of shapes that operate in Euclidean-space -- i.e. a flat 2D plane.  Most shapes are augmented to support a wrap-around at `X` -180/+180 for compatibility with latitude & longitudes, which is effectively a cylindrical model.  But the real bonus is its circle (i.e. point-radius shape that can operate on a surface-of-a-sphere model.  See below for further info.  The term "geodetic" or "geodesic" or "geo" is used here as synonymous with that model but technically those words have a more broad meaning.

| Shape      | Euclidean | Cylindrical | Spherical|
| -----------|:---------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| **Point**      | Y     | Y           | Y        |
| **Rectangle**  | Y     | Y           | Y        |
| **Circle**     | Y     | N           | Y        |
| **LineString** | Y     | N           | N        |
| **Buffered L/S** | Y   | N           | N        |
| **Polygon**    | Y     | Y           | N        |
| **ShapeCollection** | Y | Y          | Y        |

* The Rectangle shape exists in the spherical model as a lat-lon rectangle, which basically means it's math is no different than cylindrical.
* Polygons don't support pole-wrap (sorry, no Antarctica polygon); just dateline-cross.  Polygons are supported by wrapping JTS's `Geometry`, which is to say that most of the fundamental logic for that shape is implemented by JTS.

### Other Features

* Read and write Shapes as [WKT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text).  Include the ENVELOPE extension from CQL, plus a Spatial4j custom BUFFER operation. Buffering a point gets you a Circle.
* Read and write Shapes as [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#geometry-objects). 
* Read and write Shapes as [Polyshape](FORMATS.md#polyshape).
* Read and write Shapes using the [Jackson-databdind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) serialization framework.
* 3 great-circle distance calculators: Law of Cosines, Haversine, Vincenty

For more information on the formats supported, see [FORMATS.md](FORMATS.md).

## Dependencies

Spatial4j runs on Java 8 (v1.8) or better.  Otherwise, all dependencies listed in the maven [pom.xml](pom.xml) are either marked optional or are for testing. The optional dependencies are:
* [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts):  You need JTS if you use polygons, or obviously if you use any of the classes prefixed with "Jts".
* [Noggit](https://github.com/yonik/noggit): The Noggit JSON parsing library is only needed for GeoJSON parsing (not required for writing).
* [Jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind): If you wish to use Spatial4j's Jackson-databind feature to read/write shapes.

## Why not use JTS? Why should you use Spatial4j?

Spatial4j was born out of an unmet need from other open-source Java software.

[JTS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/) is the most popular spatial library in Java. 
JTS is powerful but it only supports Euclidean geometry (no geodesics) and it has no Circle shape.
Spatial4j has a geodesic circle implementation, and it wraps JTS geometries to add dateline-wrap support (no pole wrap yet).
JTS recently broadened it's licensing but originally this was a major factor contributing to the founding of Spatial4j. 

A geodesic circle implementation (i.e. point-radius on surface of a sphere), has been non-trivial; see for yourself and look at the extensive testing.  Presumably many applications will use a polygon substitute for a circle, however note that not only is it an approximation, but common algorithms *inscribe* instead of *circumscribe* the circle. The result is a polygon that doesn't quite completely cover the intended shape, potentially resulting in not finding desired data when applied to the information-retrieval domain (e.g. indexing/search in Apache Lucene) where it is usually better to find a false match versus not find a positive match when making approximations.  Also, Spatial4j's implementation goes to some lengths to be efficient by only calculating the great-circle-distance a minimum number of times in order to find the intersection relationship with a rectangle.  Even computing the bounding-box of this shape was non-obvious, as the initial algorithm lifted from the web at a popular site turned out to be false.

## Getting Started

**[Javadoc API](https://locationtech.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/)**

The facade to all of Spatial4j is the [`SpatialContext`](https://locationtech.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/org/locationtech/spatial4j/context/SpatialContext.html).
It acts as a factory for shapes and it holds references to most other classes you might use and/or it has convenience methods for them.
For example you can get a [`DistanceCalculator`](https://locationtech.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/org/locationtech/spatial4j/distance/DistanceCalculator.html) but if you just want to calculate the distance then the context has a method for that.

To get a SpatialContext (or just "context" for short), you could use a global singleton `SpatialContext.GEO` or `JtsSpatialContext.GEO` which both use geodesic surface-of-sphere calculations (when available); the JTS one principally adds Polygon support.
If you want a non-geodesic implementation or you want to customize one of many options, then instantiate a [`SpatialContextFactory`](https://locationtech.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/org/locationtech/spatial4j/context/SpatialContextFactory.html) (or `JtsSpatialContextFactory`), set the options, then invoke `newSpatialContext()`.
If you have a set of name-value string pairs, perhaps from a java properties file, then instead use the static `makeSpatialContext(map, classLoader)` method which adds a lot of flexibility to the configuration initialization versus hard-coding it.

*You should generally avoid calling constructors for anything in Spatial4j except for the `SpatialContextFactory`.* Constructors aren't strictly forbidden but the factories are there to provide an extension point / abstraction, so don't side-step them unless there's a deliberate reason.

## Miscellaneous

Discuss Spatial4j on our [mailing list](https://locationtech.org/mailman/listinfo/spatial4j-dev) (note: old list is [here](http://spatial4j.16575.n6.nabble.com/)).

View metadata about the project as generated by Maven: [maven site](https://locationtech.github.io/spatial4j/).

Spatial4j has been ported to .NET (C#) where it is appropriately named [Spatial4n](https://github.com/synhershko/Spatial4n).

### Future Road Map Ideas

* Support for projections by incorporating Proj4j
* More surface-of-sphere implemented shapes (LineString, Polygon), such as by using Geo3D
* Polygon pole wrap
* Multi-dimensional?

### History

Before Spatial4j, there was [Lucene Spatial Playground](http://code.google.com/p/lucene-spatial-playground/) (LSP) and 
from this work a generic core spatial library emerged, independent of Lucene: Spatial4j. 
The other parts of LSP were either merged into Lucene / Solr itself or were migrated to
[Spatial Solr Sandbox](https://github.com/ryantxu/spatial-solr-sandbox).  
On February 26th 2016, with release 0.6, Spatial4j became a LocationTech project (a part of Eclipse) following a long
incubation period.
